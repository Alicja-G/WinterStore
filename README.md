# WinterStore

This project is used purely for learning how ASP.NET MVC works.

The goal is to create simple application which can be used to rent winter equipment for customers (and keeping track for it) 
as well as letting customers simply view and browse equipment. 

The application uses ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework (Code-first approach), WEB API 2 Controllers and some jQuery plugins (for example Datatables). 

For authorization purposes, not every user is able to view the whole application. 
For all features there is a need to be logged as: admin@winterstore.com with password: Admin-111 . 

As I'm currently working on this project, it's not finished yet. 

Things that can be done as for now: 
- view/add/edit list of all equipment
- view/add/edit list of all customers
- view rental form 

Things to do: 
- enabling adding/editing rentals
- adding views for seperate type of equipment
- CSS styling
- applying more roles to actions in controllers
- fixing bug with not being able to log on in Chrome
